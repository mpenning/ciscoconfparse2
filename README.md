## Introduction: What is ciscoconfparse2?

### Summary

[ciscoconfparse2][17] is similar to an advanced grep and diff that
specializes in network configuration files (such as those from Cisco,
Juniper, Palo Alto, etc); it is the next generation of
[ciscoconfparse][64], which was the primary development package
from 2007 until 2023.

### CLI Tool

[ciscoconfparse2][17] distributes a [CLI tool][67] that will diff and grep various
network configuration or text files.

### Simple Python API Usage

In addition to the CLI tool, [ciscoconfparse2][17] also offers a Python API.

This example code parses a configuration stored in
`tests/fixtures/configs/sample_02.ios` and select interfaces that are shutdown.

In this case, the parent is a line containing `interface` and the child is a
line containing the word `shutdown`.

```python
# filename: example.py
from ciscoconfparse2 import CiscoConfParse

##############################################################################
# Find all Cisco IOS interface names that are shutdown
##############################################################################
#
# Search for:
#     !
#     interface Foo
#      description ignore-this-line
#      shutdown
#     !

# Search a configuration in the test fixutres directory
parse = CiscoConfParse('tests/fixtures/configs/sample_02.ios', syntax='ios')

# Find a parent line containing 'interface' and child line with 'shutdown'
for intf_obj in parse.find_parent_objects(['interface', 'shutdown']):
    intf_name = " ".join(intf_obj.split()[1:])
    print(f"Shutdown: {intf_name}")
```

That will print:

```none
$ python example.py
Shutdown: FastEthernet0/7
Shutdown: FastEthernet0/8
Shutdown: FastEthernet0/9
Shutdown: FastEthernet0/11
Shutdown: FastEthernet0/13
Shutdown: FastEthernet0/15
Shutdown: FastEthernet0/17
Shutdown: FastEthernet0/19
Shutdown: FastEthernet0/20
Shutdown: FastEthernet0/22
Shutdown: VLAN1
```

### Complex Python API Example

The following code will parse a configuration stored in
`tests/fixtures/configs/sample_08.ios` and will find the
IP address / switchport parameters assigned to interfaces.

```python
from ciscoconfparse2 import CiscoConfParse
from ciscoconfparse2 import IPv4Obj

def intf_csv(intf_obj: str) -> str:
    """
    :return: CSV for each interface object.
    :rtype: str
    """
    intf_name = " ".join(intf_obj.split()[1:])    # Use a string split() method from the BaseCfgLine()
    admin_status = intf_obj.re_match_iter_typed("^\s+(shutdown)", default="not_shutdown", result_type=str)
    # Search children of all interfaces for a regex match and return
    # the value matched in regex match group 1.  If there is no match,
    # return a default value: 0.0.0.1/32
    addr_netmask = intf_obj.re_match_iter_typed(
        r"^\s+ip\saddress\s(\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+\s\S+)", result_type=IPv4Obj,
        group=1, default=IPv4Obj("0.0.0.1/32"))
    # Find the description and replace all commas in it
    description = intf_obj.re_match_iter_typed("description\s+(\S.*)").replace(",", "_")

    switchport_status = intf_obj.re_match_iter_typed("(switchport)", default="not_switched")

    # Return a csv based on whether this is a switchport
    if switchport_status == "not_switched":
        return f"{intf_name},{admin_status},{addr_netmask.as_cidr_addr},{switchport_status},,,{description}"

    else:
        # Only calculate switchport values if this is a switchport
        trunk_access = intf_obj.re_match_iter_typed("switchport mode (trunk)", default="access", result_type=str)
        access_vlan = intf_obj.re_match_iter_typed("switchport access vlan (\d+)", default=1, result_type=int)

        return f"{intf_name},{admin_status},,{switchport_status},{trunk_access},{access_vlan},{description}"

parse = CiscoConfParse('tests/fixtures/configs/sample_08.ios', syntax='ios')

# Find interface BaseCfgLine() instances...
for intf_obj in parse.find_objects('^interface'):
    print(intf_csv(intf_obj))
```

That will print:

```none
$ python example.py

### Cisco IOS Factory Usage

CiscoConfParse has a special feature that abstracts common IOS / NXOS / ASA / IOS XR fields; at this time, it is only useful on IOS configurations. You will see factory parsing in CiscoConfParse code as parsing the configuration with `factory=True`.

Factory parsing is still beta-quality and should be used at your own risk.

## Why

[ciscoconfparse2][17] is a [Python][10] library
that helps you quickly answer questions like these about your
Cisco configurations:

- What interfaces are shutdown?
- Which interfaces are in trunk mode?
- What address and subnet mask is assigned to each interface?
- Which interfaces are missing a critical command?
- Is this configuration missing a standard config line?

It can help you:

- Audit existing router / switch / firewall / wlc configurations
- Modify existing configurations
- Build new configurations

Speaking generally, the library examines an IOS-style config and breaks
it into a set of linked parent / child relationships. You can perform
complex queries about these relationships.

### What changed in ciscoconfparse2?

In late 2023, I started a rewrite because [ciscoconfparse][64] is too large 
and has some defaults that I wish it didn't have.  I froze
[ciscoconfparse][64] PYPI releases at [version 1.9.41][65]; there will be no
more [ciscoconfparse][64] PYPI releases.

What do you do?  Upgrade to [ciscoconfparse2][17]!

Here's why, it:

- Includes a handy [CLI command][67] (including greps for mac addresses and IPv4 / IPv6 subnets)
- Streamlines the API towards a simpler user interface.
- Removes legacy and flawed methods from the original (this could be a breaking change for old scripts).
- Adds string methods to `BaseCfgLine()` objects
- Defaults `ignore_blank_lines=False` (this could be a breaking change for old scripts).
- Is better at handling multiple-child-level configurations (such as IOS XR and JunOS)
- Can search for parents and children using an *arbitrary list of ancestors*
- Adds the concept of change commits; this is a config-modification safety feature that [ciscoconfparse][64] lacks
- Adds an `auto_commit` keyword, which defaults True
- Documents much more of the API
- Intentionally requires a different import statement to minimize confusion between the original and [ciscoconfparse2][17]
- Vasly improves Cisco IOS diffs

## What if we don\'t use Cisco IOS?

In many cases, you can parse [brace-delimited configurations][13] into a Cisco IOS style (see [original ciscoconfparse Github Issue \#17][14]), which means that CiscoConfParse may be able to parse these configurations:

- Juniper Networks Junos OS
- Palo Alto Networks Firewall configurations
- F5 Networks configurations (known caveats)

CiscoConfParse also handles anything that has a Cisco IOS style of configuration, which includes:

- Cisco IOS, Cisco Nexus, Cisco IOS-XR, Cisco IOS-XE, Aironet OS, Cisco ASA, Cisco CatOS
- Arista EOS
- Brocade
- HP Switches
- Force 10 Switches
- Dell PowerConnect Switches
- Extreme Networks
- Enterasys
- Screenos

## Docs

- The latest copy of the docs are [archived on the web][15]

## Installation and Downloads

-   Use `pip` for Python3.x\... :

        python -m pip install ciscoconfparse2

## What is the pythonic way of handling script credentials?

1. Never hard-code credentials
2. Use [python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv)


## Is this a tool, or is it artwork?

That depends on who you ask.  Many companies use CiscoConfParse as part of their
network engineering toolbox; others regard it as a form of artwork.

## Pre-requisites

[The ciscoconfparse2 python package][3] requires Python versions 3.7+.

Type-hinting (work-in-progress) targets Python3.9+ due to the need for `tuple[str, ...]` hints.

## Other Resources

- [Dive into Python3](http://www.diveintopython3.net/) is a good way to learn Python
- [Team CYMRU][30] has a [Secure IOS Template][29], which is especially useful for external-facing routers / switches
- [Cisco\'s Guide to hardening IOS devices][31]
- [Center for Internet Security Benchmarks][32] (An email address, cookies, and javascript are required)

## Are you releasing licensing besides GPLv3?

I will not. however, if it's truly a problem for your company, there are commercial solutions available (to include purchasing the project, or hiring me).

## Bug Tracker and Support

- Please report any suggestions, bug reports, or annoyances with a [github bug report][24].
- If you\'re having problems with general python issues, consider searching for a solution on [Stack Overflow][33].  If you can\'t find a solution for your problem or need more help, you can [ask on Stack Overflow][34] or [reddit/r/Python][39].
- If you\'re having problems with your Cisco devices, you can contact:
  - [Cisco TAC][28]
  - [reddit/r/Cisco][35]
  - [reddit/r/networking][36]
  - [NetworkEngineering.se][23]

## Build and Development

I recommend that you use [`hatch`][69] to build and manage the package versions.

Typical development workflow looks like this:

- git clone this repo
- make changes
- git commit your code changes
- `hatch run pytest`
- Edit `CHANGES.md` with your changes
- Bump the `ciscoconfparse2` version number in `ciscoconfparse2/__about__.py` with `hatch version micro` or `hatch version minor`
- Publish to github with `make cicd`
- `cd sphinx-doc` and `make html`
- publish documentation changes

## Unit-Tests and SonarCloud

- We are manually disabling some [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/) alerts with:
  - `#pragma warning disable S1313`
  - `#pragma warning restore S1313`
  - Where `S1313` is a False-positive that [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io) flags
  - Those `#pragma warning` lines should be carefully-fenced to ensure that we don't disable a [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/) alert that is useful.

### Semantic Versioning and Conventional Commits

- At this point, [ciscoconfparse2][3] does NOT adhere to [Semantic Versioning][49]
- Although we added [commitizen][48] as a dev dependency, we are NOT enforcing commit rules (such as [Conventional Commits][50]) yet.

### Execute Unit tests

The project\'s [test workflow][1] checks ciscoconfparse2 on Python versions 3.7 and higher, as well as a [pypy JIT][22] executable.

If you already git cloned the repo and want to manually run tests either run with `make test` from the base directory, or manually run with [`pytest`][63] in a unix-like system...

```shell
$ cd tests
$ pytest ./test*py
...
```

### Execute Test Coverage Line-Miss Report

If you already have have `pytest` and `pytest-cov` installed, run a test line miss report as shown below.

```shell
$ # Install the latest ciscoconfparse2
$ # (assuming the latest code is on pypi)
$ pip install -U ciscoconfparse2
$ pip install -U pytest-cov
$ cd tests
$ pytest --cov-report=term-missing --cov=ciscoconfparse2 ./
...
```

### Sphinx Documentation

Building the ciscoconfparse2 documentation tarball comes down to this one wierd trick:

- `cd sphinx-doc/`
- `pip install ciscoconfparse`
- `make html`
